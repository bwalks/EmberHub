[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bwalks/EmberHub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwalks/EmberHub)

Simple Ember.js project that adds GitHub user account to see user's repositories

In order to run, you need to run:

```
npm install
grunt
```

This will build the app and start a static web server. This only uses the local storage in the browser, and interacts directly with the GitHub API.
